HTTP Status Line Mappings
-------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Michael Eichelsdoerfer
Build Date: 2010-03-10
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.6 or greater


Allows more control over Frontend page HTTP response header status lines
using customizable page types. Each mapping is stored in the Symphony config
file, and page type is matched against these mappings.


[CREDITS]

This extension is based completely on Alistair Kearney's Content Type Mappings
extension.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Enable the extension
2. Add HTTP status line mappings to your /manifest/config.php file with the
   format 'STATUS' => 'HEADER STATUS LINE', E.G.:

		###### HTTP-STATUS-LINE-MAPPINGS ######
		'http-status-line-mappings' => array(
			'503' => 'HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable',
		),
		########

3. If a page uses a type listed in the config, that appropriate HTTP header
   status line will be set. Should more than one match be found, the last
   one encountered will be used.
